# Geode IP Engineering Frontend Challenge

## Introduction

Hello there! Thank you for your interest in interviewing with Geode IP.

This challenge is designed to give us a better understanding of how you work and problem-solve for front-end software development. This is another way for you to shine in our interview pipeline. You should **expect to spend 3 to 4 hours on this challenge** depending on how familiar you are with your project setup.

## The Challenge

We've noticed that when customers have a fun experience using a product, they tend to evangelize that product more often.
In the world of SaaS software the best way to get the next customer is from an existing customer. 

We want to add an easter egg feature that will allow users to unlock funny GIF searching, but first we need a page that will allow users to search for gifs.

## Requirements

You have to complete the following **three requirements** below.

When you are done, check out the [submission guidelines](#submitting).

### Requirements 1

- Create a page that shows GIFs based on a search term entered by the user.
  - Your page should show gifs for two additional "adjacent" search terms. Note: The word "adjacent" in this context is purposely vague. Feel free to decide how to determine two additional search terms based on the search term entered by the user.
- Leverage the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide)
- The page should respond to the users input without the user having to press a "Search" button.
- Always return exactly 3 results per search term, or 0 results if there are less than 3 available per search term

### Requirements 2

Add and complete `Instructions.md` file to provide instructions on how to build, run tests and start your service on port 8080

### Requirements 3

Add a section to the `Instructions.md` file to tell us what improvements you would make, if any, to make it "production ready".

## Submitting

When you are satisfied with your work, submit the files either through email or via a google/outlook/dropbox folder.

## Evaluation

We're going to be evaluating your project on the following criteria

- Did you meet all of the requirements?
- Did you provide clear instructions on how to build and run your code?
- How easy is it for someone new to your project to understand your code and your testing strategy?
- Did you address edge cases in input sizes, latency?
- Within the framework of your choice of technology ecosystem, we will review your design decisions, the application structure, clean code principles.

## Feedback

We are always looking to improve our candidatesâ€™ experience in our interview pipeline. We would appreciate any feedback you can share about your experience with the challenge, fun or frustrating. It will be incredibly helpful to refine the process for future candidates. Thank you!
